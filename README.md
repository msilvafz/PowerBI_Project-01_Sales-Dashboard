# 📊 Global Sales Analytical Dashboard

## 📌 Project Description
This repository contains my **first Power BI project**, developed during the course *Microsoft Power BI for Business Intelligence and Data Science (DSA)*.  
The goal was to create a **Global Sales Analytical Dashboard**, transforming business questions into **clear and actionable insights**.

---

## 🚀 Dashboard Features
The dashboard was built to answer key business questions, such as:

- **What is the total sales value?**  
- **How many sales were made by product category?** (Pie chart — suitable for few categories)  
- **How many sales were made by country considering delivery priority?** (Stacked bar chart — useful to compare multiple metrics at once)  
- **What is the average discount per product subcategory?** (Horizontal bar chart — makes comparisons across subcategories easier and more intuitive)  
- **Which countries had the highest average sales value?** (World map — with a filter applied to display only countries with sales above 250,000, avoiding visual clutter)  

Additionally, **data slicers** were added, allowing the user to filter results by **year, segment, and country**, making the dashboard fully **interactive**.

## 🧪 Data Preparation
The project also introduced the use of **Power Query**, where I learned how to:
- Identify and standardize **data types**:  
  - ABC = Text  
  - Calendar = Date  
  - 1.2 = Decimal  
  - 123 = Whole Number  

This step is fundamental to ensure **data quality and consistency**.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Recognizing and cleaning data types in **Power Query**.  
- Choosing the **right visualization** for each business question.  
- Applying **filters** to improve readability of visualizations.  
- Enhancing user experience through **formatting and dashboard design**.  
- Creating **interactive dashboards** with slicers (Year, Segment, Country).
