# 📊 Global Sales Analytical Dashboard

---

## 📌 Description

This project was developed as part of my journey in **Business Intelligence and Data Analytics**, using **Power BI** to build a **Global Sales Analytical Dashboard**.

The goal was to transform raw data into **strategic insights**, applying techniques of **data modeling, analysis, and visualization** to support **data-driven decision-making**.

🔎 Beyond dashboard creation, this project applied concepts of **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**, **data storytelling**, and **interactive dashboard design**, always focusing on clarity and visual impact.
